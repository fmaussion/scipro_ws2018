    "A very simple encryption technique is called the [Caesar cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). The basic idea is that each letter is replaced by a letter that is a certain number of letters away, so for example if the shift was 2, then A would become C, B would become D, and Z will become B.\n",

    "**A. Write a function that given a string and a shift, will produce the encrypted string for that shift**. The rules are:\n",
    "- you should accept lowercase and uppercase letters, and return letters of the same case\n",
    "- spaces or other punctuation characters should not be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to reach this result. Just pick the one which makes more sense to you. Then, decrypt the following message, which was encrypted with a shift of 13:\n",
