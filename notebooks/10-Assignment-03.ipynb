    "[SRTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission) is a digital elevation model at ~90 m resolution covering almost the entire globe (up to $\\pm$ 60° latitude). The data is organized in 5°x5° tiles. To see a map of the tiles have a look at [this download page](http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SELECTION/inputCoord.asp). This tool is nice to use if you know which tile you want, but not very useful if you want more than one tile at different places of the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the entire dataset is available on this server: http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SRT-ZIP/SRTM_V41/SRTM_Data_GeoTiff/\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to protect from naive \"download all\" behavior, the files stored here cannot be listed (i.e. automated data scraping won't work). Fortunately for us , the file naming convention is very simple:\n",
    "- example file: http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/SRT-ZIP/SRTM_V41/SRTM_Data_GeoTiff/srtm_39_04.zip\n",
    "- the first two digits number gives the location of the tile in the longitudes (starting at 180° West)\n",
    "- the last two digits gives the location of the tile in the latitudes (starting at 60° North and going southwards)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of locations and their associated tile:\n",
    "- (-179, 59) -> 'srtm_01_01.zip'\n",
    "- (-179, 51) -> 'srtm_01_02.zip'\n",

    "*Hint 2: unlike last week where we asked for user input, here I'm asking for a script with [command line arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html?highlight=sys%20argv#command-line-arguments).*\n",
    "\n",
    "**B.** Extend this script to be a bit more clever: **download the data file only if the file isn't already available in the current directory**. This is particularly important because since last year their server has changed and the new one is *much* slower. Now you'd better not download the files two times...\n",
    "\n",
    "**C.** Extend this script to be even more clever: **given a range of longitudes and latitudes, it should download all the files covering this area**. For example, the range 9°W to 18°W and 44°N to 47°N would download 6 files."
