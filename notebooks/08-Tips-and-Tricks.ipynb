You know everything you need to know about the syntax (almost ;-)), but you might be a little lost in all the possibilities the language is now offering to you. *Which tool should I use to do this and that? How was this function signature again?* This chapter will briefly give you some tips to help you out during your assignments."

    "- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). In recent years, the Stack Exchange community of sites has emerged as a major resource for answering technical and other questions and is even the preferred forum for many open-source projects.

When you encounter a problem, ask yourself the following question: **is it likely that someone else had this problem before me?** In a large majority of the cases, the answer will be \"yes\" (believe me on this one).

Here is the example outcome of two google searches:\n",

    "While it is possible to write python programs using a basic text editor, the majority of you will find it useful to use an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (short: IDE) instead. The advantages of IDEs is that they ship with tools that make your life easier when programming. Here is a non-exhaustive list of the tools a good IDE should have:\n",
    "- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)\">linter</a>: automatic detection of syntax errors and style violations\n",
    "- [debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger)\n",
    "- [Intelligent code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_code_completion)\n",
    "- project explorer and code exploration tools\n",
    "- for interactive languages: a command line and variables \n",
    "- version control tools\n",
    "- automated build and testing tools\n",
    "- appealing colors and graphics\n",
    "- ... \n",

    "There are many Python IDEs, but here are some of the ones that come up most often as recommendations on forums or blogposts:\n",
    "- [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/): the IDE made by and for scientists. It resembles the Matlab IDE and has many nice features such as variable exploration and an integrated ipython console. It is very easy to install with conda, and is therefore available on linux at the university (``$ spyder &``). **It is my recommended IDE for this semester's course**.\n",
    "- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): this is my current personal favorite. It is however quite heavyweight and can be confusing for beginners.\n",
    "- [Atom](https://atom.io/): a modern, very nice looking editor. Useful if you program in more than one language, but you must install additional packages to transform it in a real IDE\n",
    "- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): for people allergic to the mouse. Not recommended for most of us, but the people who learned to use them are (allegedly) the fastest programmers ever."
