    "Now let's develop a new standard based on this representation. Dots cannot be represented by 0s and 1s, so that if we want the position of the dot to be flexible we need an additional memory slot to store this position. Let's define our new format as a 32 bits long sequence of bits, the first 5 bits (starting from the left) being used to give the position of the dot, and the remaining 27 bits used to represent the number. Examples:\n",
