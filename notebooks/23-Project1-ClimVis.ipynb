    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas of functionalities that you can adapt at wish:\n",
    "- you could add a plot of the 1901-2016 timeseries for this grid point, and make a trend analysis for the period.\n",
    "- you could add a new command to the tool called ``uibkvis``, which instead plots the data from the UIBK weather stations. For example, you could plot the temperature for all stations, or even better: give choices to the user as to what they want to plot. You'll have to document its command line options of course. You can get inspiration from [last year's excercise](https://fabienmaussion.info/scipro_ss2018/html/12-Assignment-03.html#Exercise-#03-02:-ACINN-meteorological-data), which we didn't have time to do this year.\n",
    "- you could redo the plots from the [ACINN webpage](http://acinn.uibk.ac.at/current-weather/innsbruck-university), but better?\n",
    "- you could use a python [windrose](https://github.com/python-windrose/windrose) package to plot a windrose from the uibk data, and maybe extend assignment 08 to produce a webpage (instead of the sentence it produces now)  \n",
    "- you could add an option to ``cruvis``, which accepts a city name instead of the lon and lat of the point. You could use the file shipped with the package for this (`world_cities.csv`).\n",
    "- you could add a new command line tool to compare the climate at two locations.\n",
    "- you could parse any other data you'd find interesting from the web and plot it! For example, [upper air soundings](http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html)? \n",
    "- you could use an interactive plotting library like [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org) or [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) to make reactive plots in your HTML page.\n",
