    "- **Write a test suite for the following past exercises: \"#02: cryptography\" and \"#03: automated data download\"** (one ``test_*.py`` file per module). The test suite must contain unit tests for each function you programmed (I myself wrote 4 functions for exercise #02 and 3 for exercise #03). While doing so, you might find it very useful to refactor your code following the [good practices](09-Good-practices.ipynb): write small functions with a task clearly defined, which you can test for. If you can't test it, the function is possibly not written the right way: either too broad, or not useful enough.\n",
    "- **Apply the exception handling methods learned in [lesson 18](18-Exceptions.ipynb) to the download function(s) of exercise #03**. Add a test to your test suite to verify that exceptions are raised when an invalid tile is requested for download."
